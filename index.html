      <section id="about">
        <h2>About Bedbugs</h2>
        <p>
          Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown parasitic insects that feed on the
          blood of humans and animals. They are often found in beds and
          furniture, but they can inhabit any areas that are small and cozy such
          as in between wood floors, vents, or even outlets. As long as there is
          a host for bedbugs to feed on, they will continue for as long as they
          can.
        </p>

      <section id="experience">
        <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>
          When my house became victim to the bedbugs in 2021, it was a
          horrifying experience. At first, I was not sure how to diagnose the
          numerous amounts of bug bites that I was getting overnight. I knew
          about bedbugs but I did not know how sneaky they were and they
          continued to feed off my skin every night. It got really bad to the
          point where I got insomnia due to the fear of getting that itchy
          feeling of a bug bite. Even if I changed rooms, it was only a
          temporary solution as I would wake up with more bites in a few days
          without knowing how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bedbugs are very sneaky and I learned that the hard way. I never saw
          one for awhile and neither did anyone in my family. My brother said my
          itchiness was coming from an allergic reaction to the detergent and
          that we should change it. Until one night, I woke up to one of the
          little guys crawling up into my sleeve filled up with blood. Not a
          great sight. The smart thing to do would've been to call an
          exterminator right away to get rid of them. However for me, I resorted
          to the internet and researched what I could do in order to get rid of
          bedbugs at home. I vacuumed everywhere in each room and found hidden
          bugs laying underneath in tight areas of the bed frames, and then I
          set bedbug traps under my bed posts to catch them if they tried
          crawling onto my bed which for the most part worked. But they kept on
          coming back so we ended up calling the exterminator anyway.

        <h2>Signs</h2>
        <p>
          There are many signs of possible bedbugs in your house but they are
          subtle. Take note of these signs if you suspect that you have bedbugs
          in your house.

        <p>
          Finally if you have a group of bug bites in one area especially in
          areas that make contact with your bed, they are most likely the result
          of bedbugs.

      <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>Follow these tips to prevent bedbug infestations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Regularly inspect and clean your living space.</em> Bedbugs like
            to take shelter wherever they can and will not hesitate to hide in
            your laundry.
          </li>
          <li><em>Use mattress covers.</em></li>
          <li>
            <em>Be cautious</em> when traveling to avoid bringing bedbugs home.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          If you suspect a bedbug infestation, consider the following
          treatments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hire a professional pest control service.</li>
          <li>Wash and vacuum affected areas thoroughly.</li>
          <li>Dispose of infested items and clothing properly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some things <b>NOT</b> to do include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Move items around from infested areas.</em> It is difficult to
            determine if items in your room are also inhabited with bugs so this
            will spread the issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Sleep in a different room.</em> Bedbugs can actually migrate at
            a relatively quick speed to different rooms if they have no food,
            which will only lead to spreading the problem <b>unless</b> you can
            stop them from crawling up to your sleep area.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Bedbug bombs.</em> This is a temporary solution which only
            displaces the bugs.
          </li>
        </ul>
