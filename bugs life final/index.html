        <h2>About Bedbugs</h2>
        <p>
          Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown parasitic insects that feed on the
          blood of humans and animals. They are often found in beds and
          furniture, but they can inhabit any areas that are small and cozy such
          as in between wood floors, vents, or even outlets. They are spread
          through contact and can latch onto items and luggage that a person is
          carrying which will lead their way into their home to feed on their
          host(s). As long as there is a host for bedbugs to feed on, they will
          continue for as long as they live.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bedbug's scientific name is <em>Cimex lectularius</em>. Their
          lifecycle consists of 5 larval stages:

        <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>
          When my house became victim to the bedbugs in 2021, it was a
          horrifying experience. At first, I was not sure how to diagnose the
          numerous amounts of bug bites that I was getting overnight. I knew
          about bedbugs but I did not know how sneaky they were and they
          continued to feed off my skin every night. It got really bad to the
          point where I got insomnia due to the fear of getting that itchy
          feeling of a bug bite. Even if I changed rooms, it was only a
          temporary solution as I would wake up with more bites in a few days
          without knowing how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bedbugs are very sneaky and I learned that the hard way. I never saw
          one for awhile and neither did anyone in my family. My brother said my
          itchiness was coming from an allergic reaction to the detergent and
          that we should change it. Until one night, I woke up to one of the
          little guys crawling up into my sleeve filled up with blood. Not a
          great sight. The smart thing to do would've been to call an
          exterminator right away to get rid of them. However for me, I resorted
          to the internet and researched what I could do in order to get rid of
          bedbugs at home. I vacuumed everywhere in each room and found hidden
          bugs laying underneath in tight areas of the bed frames, and then I
          set bedbug traps under my bed posts to catch them if they tried
          crawling onto my bed which worked for the most part. But they kept on
          coming back so we ended up calling the exterminator anyway.
          Nonetheless, my peace finally came back and I am hoping to spread some
          things that I know about these pests that I accrued through first hand
          experience.

      <section id="identification">
        <h2>Identification</h2>
        <p>
          Bedbugs have six legs with a pair of antennae and are brown or reddish
          depending on if they have eaten recently or not. They are about the
          size of an appleseed. The images at the top of the website should give
          you an indicator of what these bugs look like. The characteristic that
          will set them apart from other bugs with similar physical
          characteristics such as fleas is their behavior. Bedbugs are not
          erratic and move relatively slow. They do not fly but rather crawl
          their way onto a location.

      <section id="signs">
        <h2>Signs</h2>
        <p>
          There are many signs of possible bedbugs in your house but they are
          subtle. Take note of these signs if you suspect that you have bedbugs
          in your house.

        <p>
          Finally if you have a group of bug bites in one area especially in
          areas that make contact with your bed, they are most likely the result
          of bedbugs.

      <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>Follow these tips to prevent bedbug infestations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Regularly inspect and clean your living space.</em> Bedbugs like
            to take shelter wherever they can and will not hesitate to hide in
            your laundry.
          </li>
          <li><em>Use mattress covers.</em></li>
          <li>
            <em>Be cautious</em> when traveling to avoid bringing bedbugs home.
            Make sure to clean your clothes directly after a vacation and keep
            your bags in the garage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="treatment">
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          If you suspect a bedbug infestation, consider the following
          treatments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hire a professional pest control service.</li>
          <li>Wash and vacuum affected areas thoroughly.</li>
          <li>Dispose of infested items and clothing properly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some things <b>NOT</b> to do include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Move items around from infested areas.</em> It is difficult to
            determine if items in your room are also inhabited with bugs so this
            will spread the issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Sleep in a different room.</em> Bedbugs can actually migrate at
            a relatively quick speed to different rooms if they have no food,
            which will only lead to spreading the problem <b>unless</b> you can
            stop them from crawling up to your sleep area.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Bedbug bombs.</em> This is a temporary solution which only
            displaces the bugs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="overall">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          One thing I learned from bedbugs is that they are extremely
          intelligent. They will go at lengths to hide themselves from humans.
          They are able to detect the changes in CO2 levels when a human sleeps,
          so essentially they will only come out when you are asleep. Their
          hiding spots are very well hidden and it is best to check in your
          bedframe and really tear apart every corner of your room to find them.
          If you do not do that, you will just go through the same suffering
          like I did and go through a stage of denial. Perhaps its not bugs and
          its your imagination. If you are facing a problem with bedbugs, take
          them serious. Do not underestimate their will to live through
          everything and annoy you constantly.
